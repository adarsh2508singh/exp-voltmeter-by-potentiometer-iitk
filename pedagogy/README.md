1.|  <h4>(A)Calibration of voltmeter using potentiometer</h3>Connect the positive terminal of the voltmeter to the wiper (slider) of the potentiometer and the negative terminal of the voltmeter to one end of the potentiometer. <br> <h4>(B)Calibration of ammeter using potentiometer </h4> Connect the potentiometer and ammeter to a power source: Connect one end of the potentiometer to the positive terminal of the power source, the other end to the negative terminal, and the wiper to the input terminal of the ammeter. |  Setting up the Equipment: Set up a potentiometer, a voltmeter, and an ammeter, ensuring that they are all properly connected.  |  Assemble the Equipment: Assemble the potentiometer, voltmeter, and ammeter and connect them properly. 
2.|   <h4>(A)Calibration of voltmeter using potentiometer</h3>Connect the other end of the potentiometer to a power source. <br> <h4>(B)Calibration of ammeter using potentiometer </h3>Adjust the potentiometer: Turn the knob of the potentiometer to change the voltage across the wiper and the negative terminal.    |  Adjusting the Potentiometer: Turn the knob of the potentiometer to increase or decrease the resistance and hence the voltage across it. Observe the readings on the voltmeter and ammeter.  | Adjust the Potentiometer: Adjust the resistance of the potentiometer by turning its knob to vary the voltage across it. Monitor the readings on the voltmeter and ammeter.  
3.|   <h4>(A)Calibration of voltmeter using potentiometer</h3>Adjust the potentiometer to get the desired voltage value at the wiper and note it down. <br> <h3>(B)Calibration of ammeter using potentiometer </h4>Record the readings: Take note of the readings of the ammeter as you change the voltage with the potentiometer.    |   Calibrating the Voltmeter: Keep adjusting the resistance of the potentiometer until the voltmeter displays a reading of exactly 1V. If it does not match, adjust the sensitivity of the voltmeter until the reading is correct. | Calibrate the Voltmeter: Calibrate the voltmeter by adjusting its sensitivity until it displays a reading of 1V. Confirm the accuracy of the reading.
4.|   <h4>(A)Calibration of voltmeter using potentiometer</h3>Switch the voltmeter to measure DC voltage and read the value. <br> <h4>(B)Calibration of ammeter using potentiometer </h4>Compare the readings: Compare the readings of the ammeter with the voltage readings from the potentiometer. If the readings match, then the ammeter is calibrated accurately. If there is a discrepancy, adjust the sensitivity of the ammeter until the readings match.    |  Calibrating the Ammeter: Keep adjusting the resistance of the potentiometer until the ammeter displays a reading of exactly 1A. If it does not match, adjust the sensitivity of the ammeter until the reading is correct.  | Calibrate the Ammeter: Calibrate the ammeter by adjusting its sensitivity until it displays a reading of 1A. Verify the accuracy of the reading. 
5.|   <h4>(A)Calibration of voltmeter using potentiometer</h3>Repeat the above steps for multiple values of the potentiometer and make a comparison of the readings of the voltmeter with the expected values. <br> <h4>(B)Calibration of ammeter using potentiometer </h4>Repeat the process: Repeat the process for several points of the potentiometer to ensure accuracy.    |  Verifying the Calibration: Check the readings on the voltmeter and ammeter while keeping the resistance of the potentiometer constant. The readings should remain constant and match the calibrated values.  | Test the Calibration: Test the calibrated voltmeter and ammeter by keeping the resistance of the potentiometer constant. The readings should remain constant and match the calibrated values. 
6.|   <h4>(A)Calibration of voltmeter using potentiometer</h3>Based on the comparison, adjust the zero and sensitivity controls of the voltmeter until its readings match the expected values. <br> <h4>(B)Calibration of ammeter using potentiometer </h3>Check for linearity: Check if the readings are linear across the entire range of the potentiometer.    |  Recording the Results: Record the calibrated values of the voltmeter and ammeter for future reference.Repeat the Process: Repeat the process of calibrating the voltmeter and ammeter multiple times to ensure accurate results and consistency.  |  Record the Results: Record the calibrated values of the voltmeter and ammeter for future reference.<br>Repeat the Process: Repeat the calibration process multiple times to ensure consistent and accurate results.
7.|   <h4>(A)Calibration of voltmeter using potentiometer</h3>Repeat the process several times to ensure the voltmeter is accurately calibrated. <br> <h4>(B)Calibration of ammeter using potentiometer </h3>Record the calibration results: Keep a record of the calibration results for future reference.    |  Finalizing the Calibration: Once the readings are consistent and accurate, finalize the calibration process by switching off the equipment and disconnecting the wiring.  |  Finalize the Calibration: Finalize the calibration by switching off the equipment and disconnecting the wiring.

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> <br>
The instructional strategy for calibrating a voltmeter and an ammeter using a potentiometer can be as follows:<br>
1. Introduction: Explain the purpose and importance of calibrating a voltmeter and an ammeter, and briefly describe the process.
2. Theory: Provide a brief explanation of the working of a potentiometer and its role in calibrating a voltmeter and an ammeter.
3. Demonstration: Demonstrate the process of calibrating the voltmeter and ammeter, step-by-step, and show the students how to adjust the sensitivity and record the readings.
4. Guided Practice: Provide students with an opportunity to practice the process themselves, under the guidance of the instructor.
5. Independent Practice: Allow students to calibrate the voltmeter and ammeter independently, and provide them with feedback on their performance.
6. Review: Review the process and key concepts, and answer any questions students may have.
7. Assessment: Assess the students' understanding and ability to calibrate a voltmeter and ammeter using a potentiometer through a practical exam or written assessment.
8. Application: Encourage students to apply their knowledge and skills by performing the calibration process on real-life equipment, either in the laboratory or in a field setting.
###### Assessment Method:   
The assessment method for calibrating the voltmeter and ammeter using a potentiometer involves the following steps:<br>
1. Set up the equipment: Assemble the potentiometer, voltmeter, and ammeter, and ensure that they are connected properly.
2. Calibration Process: Adjust the resistance of the potentiometer, observing the readings on the voltmeter and ammeter. Repeat this process until the readings match the calibrated values of 1V and 1A.

1.|  As the student press on simulator ON button. Simulator will show the primary and secondary circuit and show them circuit component and allow to drag them.  <br> | Student will recognize the primary and secondary circuit and make connections as per theory sections suggest. <br> | To initiate the simulator and verify student concept of calibration. <br> |   
2.|  Simulator will allow student to make connection as they required and allow jockey move over the wire length just on clicking on jockey. <br> | Student will connect known emf cell with primary circuit through the jockey of a galvanometer. By moving jockey student will find the value of potential gradient (K). <br> | Student will able to calculate the value of K. <br> |
3.| Simulator will allow student to make and break connections as they required and allow jockey to move over the wire. <br> | Student will connect the component of secondary circuit with primary circuit after its student will move jockey and find the null point as per theory section. <br> | Student will able to check the value of volage drop by using potentiometer by taking aid of previous steps and also check the voltmeter reading across. <br> |
