#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.|  As the student press on simulator ON button. Simulator will show the primary and secondary circuit and show them circuit component and allow to drag them.  <br> | Student will recognize the primary and secondary circuit and make connections as per theory sections suggest. <br> | To initiate the simulator and verify student concept of calibration. <br> |   
2.|  Simulator will allow student to make connection as they required and allow jockey move over the wire length just on clicking on jockey. <br> | Student will connect known emf cell with primary circuit through the jockey of a galvanometer. By moving jockey student will find the value of potential gradient (K). <br> | Student will able to calculate the value of K. <br> |
3.| Simulator will allow student to make and break connections as they required and allow jockey to move over the wire. <br> | Student will connect the component of secondary circuit with primary circuit after its student will move jockey and find the null point as per theory section. <br> | Student will able to check the value of volage drop by using potentiometer by taking aid of previous steps and also check the voltmeter reading across. <br> |
